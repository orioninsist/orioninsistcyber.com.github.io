# What is a SOC? The Role and Responsibilities of a SOC Analyst

Cybersecurity threats are growing in complexity, making **Security Operations Centers (SOCs)** essential for protecting organizations. This article explores what a SOC is and what SOC Analysts do.

---

## 🛡️ 1. What is a Security Operations Center (SOC)?

A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is a centralized unit that **monitors, detects, and responds to cybersecurity threats 24/7**.

### 🔍 Key Objectives of a SOC
- Detect and analyze cyber threats.
- Investigate security incidents and take preventive actions.
- Analyze log data to identify potential threats.
- Use **SIEM** tools to automate threat detection.
- Manage the **Incident Response (IR)** process.

SOC teams are commonly used by:
- Large enterprises
- Financial institutions
- Government agencies
- Tech companies

---

## 👨‍💻 2. Who is a SOC Analyst? What Do They Do?

**SOC Analysts** are cybersecurity professionals who monitor systems and networks to detect suspicious activity. SOC teams are usually divided into three levels:

### 1️⃣ Tier 1 – Junior SOC Analyst *(Entry-Level)*
- Uses SIEM tools to detect threats.
- Analyzes logs for suspicious activities.
- Escalates issues to Tier 2 or Tier 3.

### 2️⃣ Tier 2 – Incident Responder *(Mid-Level)*
- Investigates and mitigates threats.
- Manages the Incident Response lifecycle.

### 3️⃣ Tier 3 – Threat Hunter *(Advanced Level)*
- Performs proactive **threat hunting**.
- Develops custom SIEM detection rules.
- Analyzes attacker tactics and techniques (e.g., using MITRE ATT&CK).

---

## 🚀 Conclusion

SOC Analysts play a **critical role in defending digital infrastructure**. Learning about **SIEM tools, log analysis, and incident response** is essential to building a successful career in cybersecurity.

In the next post, we will dive deeper into **SIEM and log analysis** — two core skills for every SOC Analyst.
