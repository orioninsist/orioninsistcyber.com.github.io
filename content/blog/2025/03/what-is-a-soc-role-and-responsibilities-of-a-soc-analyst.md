1. What is a Security Operations Center (SOC)?
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized unit that monitors, detects, and responds to cybersecurity threats 24/7.

Key Objectives of a SOC
Detect and analyze cyber threats.
Investigate security incidents and take preventive actions.
Analyze log data to identify potential threats.
Use SIEM tools to automate threat detection.
Manage the Incident Response (IR) process.
SOC teams are commonly used by large enterprises, financial institutions, government agencies, and tech companies.

2. Who is a SOC Analyst? What Do They Do?
SOC analysts are security experts who continuously monitor networks and systems to identify threats. SOC teams typically have three levels:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Tier 1 ‚Äì Junior SOC Analyst (Entry-Level)

Uses SIEM tools to detect security threats.
Analyzes logs and identifies suspicious activities.
Escalates incidents to Tier 2 or Tier 3 teams.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Tier 2 ‚Äì Incident Responder (Mid-Level)

Analyzes and mitigates security threats.
Manages the Incident Response process.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Tier 3 ‚Äì Threat Hunter (Advanced Level)

Performs proactive threat hunting.
Develops custom SIEM rules and detection algorithms.
Conclusion
SOC Analysts play a crucial role in cybersecurity. If you want to start a career in this field, learning SIEM tools, log analysis, and incident response is a great first step.

In the next post, we will dive deeper into SIEM and log analysis. üöÄ
