## 🛠️ What is SIEM?

**SIEM** is a platform that collects, aggregates, and analyzes security data from across an organization’s digital environment.

### 🔍 Core Functions of a SIEM:
- **Log Aggregation**: Collects logs from firewalls, servers, applications, and endpoints.
- **Event Correlation**: Connects related events across multiple sources.
- **Alerting**: Triggers alerts when suspicious patterns are detected.
- **Visualization**: Offers dashboards for monitoring and investigation.
- **Forensics Support**: Helps during incident investigations.

---

## 📋 Common SIEM Tools

| Tool         | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| 🔷 **Splunk** | Enterprise-grade SIEM with powerful analytics and ML. |
| ⚙️ **ELK Stack** | Open-source suite (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana). |
| 🧠 **IBM QRadar** | Used by large enterprises; strong correlation engine. |
| 🧰 **Graylog** | Lightweight and user-friendly; perfect for learning. |

Each of these platforms helps SOC Analysts turn **raw log data into actionable insights**.

---

## 📂 What is Log Analysis?

**Log Analysis** is the process of reviewing system-generated log entries to detect anomalies, attacks, or errors. It’s a critical part of incident detection and response.

### 🗂️ Typical Log Sources:
- 🔐 **Firewall Logs**
- 🧱 **IDS/IPS Logs**
- 💻 **Windows Event Logs**
- 🐧 **Linux Syslogs**
- 🌐 **Web Server Logs (e.g., Apache, Nginx)**
- 👥 **Authentication & Login Logs**

---

## 🧑‍💻 How SOC Analysts Use SIEM for Log Analysis

SOC Analysts interact with SIEM platforms to:

1. 📈 **Monitor** systems in real-time
2. 🔎 **Search** logs using queries (e.g., Splunk SPL, Kibana KQL)
3. 🧩 **Correlate** events to find attack patterns
4. 🧪 **Investigate** incidents with supporting evidence
5. 🧠 **Improve detection rules** based on findings

---

## 🧪 Sample Query (Splunk)

```spl
index=windows sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security EventCode=4625
| stats count by Account_Name, host, _time
| where count > 5
```

🔍 This Splunk SPL query finds failed login attempts (EventCode 4625) grouped by user and host, flagging accounts with more than 5 failures — a common sign of brute-force attacks.

✅ Summary
✅ SIEM provides the intelligence.
✅ Logs provide the evidence.
✅ You, the SOC Analyst, provide the expertise.

Mastering SIEM and log analysis is a foundational skill for any SOC Analyst. By understanding what’s happening across your systems, you can detect threats faster, respond more effectively, and protect your organization from cyber attacks.

🚀 What’s Next?
In the next article, we’ll explore real-world log examples and show how to investigate potential attacks using SIEM tools.

Stay tuned, blue teamer! 🧢🛡️
