# What is SOC (Security Operations Center)?

## 1. Definition of SOC
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized unit responsible for protecting an organization from cyber threats. SOC teams continuously monitor systems to detect, analyze, and respond to threats.

## 2. Responsibilities of SOC
A SOC team performs the following tasks:

- **Security Monitoring:** Tracks system, network, and application activities in real-time.
- **Threat Analysis:** Identifies potential attacks by analyzing suspicious activities.
- **Incident Response:** Quickly and effectively responds to security breaches.
- **Vulnerability Management:** Identifies security weaknesses and takes actions to remediate them.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Collects evidence and analyzes security incidents after an attack.

## 3. SOC Structure and Levels
SOC teams typically operate in three tiers: **L1, L2, and L3.**

### ðŸ”¹ **L1 - Tier 1 (Initial Analysis)**
- Monitors incoming alerts and performs basic analysis.
- Determines the severity of incidents and escalates them as necessary.

### ðŸ”¹ **L2 - Tier 2 (In-Depth Analysis)**
- Conducts advanced threat detection and correlation analysis.
- Optimizes SIEM rules and improves detection mechanisms.

### ðŸ”¹ **L3 - Tier 3 (Expert Analysis and Incident Response)**
- Investigates complex attacks and identifies attacker tactics.
- Manages the Incident Response process and prepares post-incident reports.

## 4. Tools Used in SOC
Commonly used tools in SOC operations:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **SIEM (Splunk, ELK, Wazuh)** | Log analysis and threat detection |
| **IDS/IPS (Snort, Suricata)** | Intrusion detection and prevention |
| **Threat Intelligence (VirusTotal, MISP)** | Malware and threat analysis |
| **Forensics (Autopsy, Volatility)** | Digital forensic analysis |

## 5. Why is SOC Important?
- Cyber threats are increasing every day, posing significant risks to organizations.
- SOC enables **rapid incident response**, minimizing damage.
- Helps organizations comply with **regulations (ISO 27001, GDPR, NIST).**

## 6. Conclusion
SOC teams play a crucial role in ensuring an organizationâ€™s cybersecurity. For those looking to start a career in cybersecurity, SOC is an excellent entry point.
